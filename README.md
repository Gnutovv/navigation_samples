# navigator_sample

A new Flutter project with samples of navigators.

## Getting Started

It has follow navigators:
1. navigator
2. navigator_2
3. go_router
4. auto_route
5. beamer

Structure:

main_screen -> 3x feature_screen -> [include_screen, bottom_sheet_dialog, simple_dialog]

I will try to build navigation between screens using other navigators
